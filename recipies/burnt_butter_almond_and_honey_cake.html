      <li>Preheat oven to 160Â°C. Grease a 20cm x 30cm cake pan and line the base and sides with baking paper.</li>
      <li>Place butter in a saucepan and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes or until nut brown. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature.</li>
      <li>
        Place eggs, sugar, vanilla and half the honey in a stand mixer with the whisk attachment and whisk for 5 minutes or until pale and doubled in volume.
        Fold in almond meal, flour, baking powder, lime zest and juice and a pinch of salt flakes. Pour in two-thirds of burnt butter (stir butter well before
        adding) and fold to combine. Pour into prepared pan and smooth top.

      <li>
        Combine chopped almonds, remaining burnt butter, remaining 90g honey and a pinch of salt flakes in a bowl. Mix well then scatter evenly over batter.
        Bake on middle shelf, turning occasionally, for 40-45 minutes until golden brown and the centre springs back when lightly pressed. Drizzle over extra
        honey and cool on a wire rack in pan. Serve at room temperature.
