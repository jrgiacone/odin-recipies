                <li>avocados</li>
                <li>red onion finely chopped</li>

                <li>any other toppings such as pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese, cilantro, etc...</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Now what you have been wating for: <em>The Steps</em></h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil chicken in hot water for 15 minutes, then remove and shred.</li>
                <li>Saute onion & garlic for a couple minutes, then add shredded chicken, broth, and all other ingredients for the pulled chicken. Simmer for 5 minutes until most of the liquid has absorbed into chicken.</li>
                <li>After that, cook bell peppers and onion on high heat until vegetables are sizzling, about 2 minutes and stirring often.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, mix all ingredients for guacamole together and prepare other ingredients such as pinto beans, cheese, pico de gallo, etc.</li>
                <li>et up a station where everyone can go and get their favourite toppings. Add a small amount of chicken, veggies, beans, cheese and other desired toppings to each flour tortilla, placing all ingredients in the middle of each tortilla. Fold up each side of your tortilla and then roll to form a wrap.</li>
                <li>Optional step: fry the burrito on all sides in a pan that's placed on med-high heat. This will toast the burrito a bit so that it doesn't get soggy. Cut in half with a very sharp knife and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
